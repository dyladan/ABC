Always Be Coding
================

My portfolio of useful, useless, and random things
--------------------------------------------------

This is inspired by [this great blog post][https://medium.com/tech-talk/d5f8051afce2]. It explains that in order to be valuable
in a competitive market, you have to make yourself competitive by constantly coding. It makes the distinction between
simple google searches for "programming problems" or "computer science interview questions" and real, applicable things like
data structures and algorithms.  In a job or even a job interview it is much more valuable to be able to understand fundamentals
than it is to be able to find the 135th factorial or the 359th prime.

The algorithms and data structures so far come from [this web site][http://bigocheatsheet.com]. I highly recommend it as a resource
for referencing algorithms and data structures, as well as their time and space complexity. It also has a handy cheat sheet at the
bottom for people who don't know or remember how to read big O notation. Happy coding! :)
